### :octicons-code-24: Observer:onChange()

Connects the given callback as a change handler, and returns a function which
will disconnect the callback. The callback will run whenever the observed
dependency is updated.

```Lua
(callback: () -> ()) -> (() -> ())
```
#### Parameters

- `callback` - The function to call when a change is observed

!!! caution "Connection memory leaks"
	Make sure to disconnect any change handlers made using this function once
	you're done using them.

	As long as a change handler is connected, this observer and the dependency
	it observes will be held in memory in case further changes occur. This means,
	if you don't call the disconnect function, you may end up accidentally
	holding your state objects in memory forever after you're done using them.

### :octicons-code-24: Observer:onBind()

Connects the given callback as a change handler, and returns a function which will disconnect the callback. The callback is run immediately, and re-run whenever the observed dependency is updated.

```Lua
(callback: () -> ()) -> (() -> ())
```
#### Parameters

- `callback` - The function to call when a change is observed **and** when the observer is created

!!! caution "Connection memory leaks"
	Make sure to disconnect any change handlers made using this function once
	you're done using them.

	As long as a change handler is connected, this observer and the dependency
	it observes will be held in memory in case further changes occur. This means,
	if you don't call the disconnect function, you may end up accidentally
	holding your state objects in memory forever after you're done using them.

## Example Usage

```Lua
local numCoins = Value(50)

local coinObserver = Observer(numCoins)

local disconnect = coinObserver:onChange(function()
	print("coins is now:", peek(numCoins))
end)

numCoins:set(25) -- prints 'coins is now: 25'

-- always clean up your connections!
disconnect()
```

```Lua
local someValue = Value("")

function update()
	someObject.Text = peek(someValue)
end

local disconnect = Observer(someValue):onBind(update)

-- always clean up your connections!
disconnect()
```
