```Lua
function Fusion.Hydrate(
	target: Instance
): (
	props: PropertyTable
) -> Instance
```

Given an instance, returns a component for binding extra functionality to that
instance.

In the property table, string keys are assigned as properties on the instance.
If the value is a [state object](../../../state/types/stateobject), it is
re-assigned every time the value of the state object changes.

Any [special keys](../../types/specialkey) present in the property table are
applied to the instance after string keys are processed, in the order specified
by their `stage`.

A special exception is made for assigning `Parent`, which is only assigned after
the `descendants` stage.

!!! warning "Do not overwrite properties"
	If the instance was previously created with [`New`](../new) or previously
	hydrated, do not assign to any properties that were previously specified in
	those prior calls. Duplicated assignments can interfere with each other in
	unpredictable ways.
