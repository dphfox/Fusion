For the best Fusion experience, you can try out a range of developer tools. 
These aren't strictly required to use Fusion, but they can make your life a lot
better!

-----

## FusionKit

FusionKit is a range of officially-endorsed tools distributed alongside the
[Elttob&nbsp;Suite](https://suite.elttob.uk/). They're designed to take
advantage of dedicated deep Fusion integrations, and are kept up to date with
new releases of Fusion.

!!! note "Work in progress"
	Official developer tools are still in the works; in the meantime, feel 
	free to check out the community's recommendations below!

-----

## Community Tools

These tools are unofficial, community-made contributions. The Fusion project
make no guarantees about them, and you won't be able to get support for them
here. However, if you're looking for a broader diversity of options, then they
may have something to offer ðŸ™‚

??? question "Have a new tool for this page?"
	If you use a component library, Roblox plugin, extension, command-line tool,
	or something else that benefits your developer workflow, you can suggest it
	for inclusion on this page!

	Before adding a community tool to this page, it should meet various
	criteria:

	- The tool must abide by Roblox's Terms of Service.
	- The tool must be notable and actively used within the Fusion community.
	- The tool should be compatible with a modern Fusion release.
		- General purpose tools are also accepted if they can be used with
		Fusion.

	If you believe a tool meets these criteria, you may add some details to this
	page, using these guidelines:

	- Tools must be sorted alphabetically for neutrality.
	- Descriptions should be short with a neutral, professional tone.
		- In particular, do not exaggerate, market, or attempt to elevate one
		tool over another.
	- Descriptions should usefully define the tool's capabilities.
		- Ensure that it's clear how the tool works with Fusion, and give
		an accurate impression of the level of integration.
	- You may only use these links:
		- Get on Creator&nbsp;Store: `create.roblox.com`
		- Get on itch.io: `itch.io`
		- Add to Visual&nbsp;Studio&nbsp;Code: `marketplace.visualstudio.com`
		- Code on GitHub: `github.com`
		- Learn more: `github.io`, `devforum.roblox.com`
		- All other links are disallowed unless an explicit exception is made by
		a Fusion maintainer (e.g. well-known domains like `rojo.space`).

	If you're not sure, then follow the example of other listings. When you're
	ready,
	[open a pull request with your changes](https://github.com/dphfox/Fusion/pulls) 
	and Fusion maintainers will review your additions for possible inclusion.
