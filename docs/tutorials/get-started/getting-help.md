If you're struggling to understand a concept, or need help debugging an error,
here are some resources which can help.

## Get Help With Errors

Whenever Fusion outputs a message to the console, it will contain a link to a
page which will tell you more about what the message means, and why it appeared.

```hl_lines="3"
[Fusion] The Frame class doesn't have a property called 'Activated'.
ID: cannotConnectChange
Learn more: https://elttob.uk/Fusion/0.3/api-reference/general/errors/#cannotconnectchange
```

When you follow that link, it will take you to
[the Errors page](../../../api-reference/general/errors), which describes every
single message that Fusion can show you, what parts of Fusion are related to
each message, and any relevant ongoing discussions on the Fusion repository that
may contain useful context.

When you run into an error, that page is a great place to start!

## Working Examples

If you would like to see more practical examples of Fusion being used to build
larger systems, then take a look at
[the Examples section](../../../examples).

The example projects can be a great place to learn how Fusion code should look
in a complete project, and help you to structure your own projects in ways that
are easy to extend as you grow.

Additionally, there's a [cookbook](../../../examples/cookbook) full of explained
code snippets, which show you how to achieve common tasks in an idiomatic and
professional way using Fusion.
