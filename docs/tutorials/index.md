Welcome to the Fusion tutorial section! Here, you'll learn how to build great
things with Fusion, even if you're a complete newcomer to the library.

You'll not only learn how Fusion's features work, but you'll also be presented
with wisdom from those who've worked with some of the largest Fusion codebases
today.

!!! warning "But first, some advice from the maintainers..."
	**<span style="font-size: 1.5em; color: var(--fusiondoc-accent);">
	Fusion is pre-1.0 software.
	</span>**

	We *(the maintainers and contributors)* work hard to keep releases bug-free
	and relatively complete, so it should be safe to use in production. Many
	people already do, and report fantastic results!

	However, we mark Fusion as pre-1.0 because we are working on the design of
	the library itself. We strive for the best library design we can deliver,
	which means breaking changes are common and sweeping.

	With Fusion, you should expect:

	- upgrades to be frictionful, requiring code to be rethought
	- features to be superseded or removed across versions
	- advice or best practices to change over time

	You should *also* expect:

	- careful consideration around breakage, even though we reserve the right to
	  do it
	- clear communication ahead of any major changes
	- helpful advice to answer your questions and ease your porting process

	We hope you enjoy using Fusion!

## What You Need To Know

These tutorials assume:

- That you're comfortable with the Luau scripting language.
	- These tutorials aren't an introduction to Luau! If you'd like to learn,
	check out the [Roblox documentation](https://create.roblox.com/docs).
- That - if you're using Roblox features - you're familiar with how Roblox works.
    - You don't have to be an expert! Knowing about basic instances, events
	and data types will be good enough.

Based on your existing knowledge, you may find some tutorials easier or harder.
Don't be discouraged - Fusion's built to be easy to learn, but it may still take
a bit of time to absorb some concepts. Learn at a pace which is right for you.
