Welcome to the Fusion tutorial section! Here, you'll learn how to build great
things with Fusion, even if you're a complete newcomer to the library.

!!! caution "But first, something important..."
	**<span style="font-size: 1.5em; color: var(--fusiondoc-accent);">
	Do not use Fusion for real-world production work unless you're 100,000%
	willing and able to withstand large breaking changes.
	</span>**

	Fusion is in beta right now! You *will* encounter:

	- bugs in core features
	- updates that completely remove existing features
	- changes in behaviour between versions
	- changing advice on coding conventions and how to structure your project

	This is not a bad thing! Moving fast with Fusion at this early stage means
	we can quickly abandon counterproductive ideas and features, and discover
	much more solid foundations to build upon.

	Don't be discouraged from Fusion though; feel free to follow along with our
	development and try using the library in your own time! More stable,
	long-term Fusion versions will be available once Fusion exits beta testing.

## What You Need To Know

These tutorials assume:

- You're comfortable with Roblox and the Luau scripting language.
	- These tutorials aren't an introduction to scripting! If you'd like to
	  learn, check out the [Roblox DevHub](https://developer.roblox.com/).
- You're familiar with how UI works on Roblox.
    - You don't have to be a designer - knowing about UI instances, events
	and data types like `UDim2` and `Color3` will be good enough.

Of course, based on your existing knowledge, you may find some tutorials easier
or harder. Fusion's built to be easy to learn, but it may still take a bit of
time to absorb some concepts, so don't be discouraged :slightly_smiling_face:

## Installing Fusion

Fusion is distributed as a single module script. Before starting, you'll need
to add this module script to your game. Here's how:

### If you edit scripts in Roblox Studio...

Head over to [Fusion's 'Releases' page](https://github.com/Elttob/Fusion/releases).
Click the 'Assets' dropdown to view the downloadable files:

![Picture of Fusion's GitHub Releases page, with the Assets dropdown highlighted.](index/Github-Releases-Guide-1-Light.png#only-light)
![Picture of Fusion's GitHub Releases page, with the Assets dropdown highlighted.](index/Github-Releases-Guide-1-Dark.png#only-dark)

Now, click on the `Fusion.rbxm` file to download it. This contains the module as
a Roblox model:

![The Assets dropdown opened to reveal downloads, with Fusion.rbxm highlighted.](index/Github-Releases-Guide-2-Light.png#only-light)
![The Assets dropdown opened to reveal downloads, with Fusion.rbxm highlighted.](index/Github-Releases-Guide-2-Dark.png#only-dark)

Head into Roblox Studio to import the model; if you're just following the
tutorials, an empty baseplate will do.

Right-click on `ReplicatedStorage`, and select 'Insert from File':

![ReplicatedStorage is right-clicked, showing a context menu of items. Insert from File is highlighted.](index/Github-Releases-Guide-3-Light.png#only-light)
![ReplicatedStorage is right-clicked, showing a context menu of items. Insert from File is highlighted.](index/Github-Releases-Guide-3-Dark.png#only-dark)

Select the `Fusion.rbxm` file you just downloaded. You should see the module
script appear in `ReplicatedStorage` - you're ready to go!

### If you edit scripts externally... (advanced)

If you use an external editor to write scripts, and synchronise them into Roblox
using a plugin, you can use these alternate steps instead:

??? example "Steps (click to expand)"
	1. Head over to [Fusion's 'Releases' page](https://github.com/Elttob/Fusion/releases).
	2. Under 'Assets', download `Source code (zip)`. Inside is a copy
	of the Fusion GitHub repository.
	3. Inside the zip, copy the `src` folder - it may be inside another folder.
	4. Paste `src` into your local project, preferably in your `shared` folder
	if you have one.
	5. Rename the folder from `src` to `Fusion`.

	Once everything is set up, you should see Fusion appear in Studio when you
	next synchronise your project.

## Setting Up A Test Script

Now that you've installed Fusion, you can set up a local script for testing.
Here's how:

1. Create a `LocalScript` in `StarterGui` or `StarterPlayerScripts`.
2. Remove the default code, and paste the following code in:
```Lua linenums="1"
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
local Fusion = require(ReplicatedStorage.Fusion)
```
3. Press 'Play' - if there are no errors, everything was set up correctly!

??? fail "My script didn't work! (click to expand)"
	```
	Fusion is not a valid member of ReplicatedStorage "ReplicatedStorage"
	```

	If you're seeing this error, then your script can't find Fusion.

	This code assumes you've installed Fusion into `ReplicatedStorage`. If
	you've installed Fusion elsewhere, you'll need to tweak the `require()` on
	line 2 to point to the correct location.

	If line 2 looks like it points to the correct location, refer back to
	[the previous section](#installing-fusion) and double-check you've set
	everything up properly. Make sure you have a `ModuleScript` inside
	`ReplicatedStorage` called "Fusion".
