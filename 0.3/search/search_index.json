Fusion introduces modern 'reactive' concepts for managing code, so you can spend more time getting your logic right, and less time implementing buggy boilerplate code connections. Starting from simple roots, concepts neatly combine and build up with very little learning curve.

Getting started guide Download Scroll down for a quick look at 3 main features. Representing change \u00b6 Fusion introduces \u2018state objects\u2019. They aren\u2019t that complex, but allow you to write dynamic code that\u2019s highly readable, behaves predictably and splits into parts easily. State objects are used to represent changeable or dynamic values in your program. You can peek at their value at any time. -- For example, suppose this function returned a state object. local currentTimeObj = getCurrentTimeStateObject () -- State objects are objects... print ( typeof ( currentTimeObj )) --> table -- ...and you can peek at their value (or \u2018state\u2019) at any time. print ( currentTimeObj : get ()) --> 0.0 task . wait ( 5 ) print ( currentTimeObj : get ()) --> 5.0 You can write out your logic using Fusion's built-in state objects. Here's the two basic ones, Value and Computed: -- This creates a state object that you can set manually. -- You can change its value using myName:set(). local myName = Value ( \"Daniel\" ) -- This creates a state object from a calculation. -- It determines its own value automatically. local myGreeting = Computed ( function () return \"Hello! My name is \" .. myName : get () end ) To watch what a state object does, you can use an Observer. For example, you can run some code when an object changes value. -- This observer watches for when the greeting changes. local myObserver = Observer ( myGreeting ) -- Let\u2019s print out the greeting when there\u2019s a new one. local disconnect = myObserver : onChange ( function () print ( myGreeting : get ()) end ) -- This will run the code above! myName : set ( \"Danny\" ) Building instances \u00b6 Fusion offers comprehensive APIs to build or enrich instances from code, so you can easily integrate with your game scripts. Fusion provides dedicated functions to create and modify instances. They allow you to easily configure your instance in one place. -- This will create a red part in the workspace. local myPart = New \"Part\" { Parent = workspace , BrickColor = BrickColor . Red () } -- This adds on some extras after. Hydrate ( myPart ) { Material = \"Wood\" , Transparency = 0.5 } They offer powerful features to keep all your instance code close together. For example, you can listen for events or add children. -- This will create a rounded button. -- When you click it, it\u2019ll greet you. local myButton = New \"TextButton\" { Text = \"Click me\" , [ OnEvent \"Activated\" ] = function () print ( \"Hello! I\u2019m a button.\" ) end , [ Children ] = New \"UICorner\" { CornerRadius = UDim . new ( 1 , 0 ) } } You can also plug state objects in directly. The instance updates as the state object changes value. -- Creating a state object you can control... local message = Value ( \"Hello!\" ) -- Now you can plug that state object into the Text property. local myLabel = New \"TextLabel\" { Text = message } print ( myLabel . Text ) --> Hello! -- The Text property now responds to changes: message : set ( \"Goodbye!\" ) print ( myLabel . Text ) --> Goodbye! Animating anything \u00b6 Fusion gives you best-in-class tools to animate anything you can think of, completely out of the box. Fusion lets you use tweens or physically based springs to animate any value you want - not just instance properties. -- This could be anything you want, as long as it's a state object. local health = Value ( 100 ) -- Easily make it tween between values... local style = TweenInfo . new ( 0.5 , Enum . EasingStyle . Quad ) local tweenHealth = Tween ( health , style ) -- ...or use spring physics for extra responsiveness. local springHealth = Spring ( health , 30 , 0.9 ) Tween and Spring are state objects, just like anything else that changes in your program. That means it's easy to process them afterwards. -- You can round the animated health to whole numbers. local wholeHealth = Computed ( function () return math . round ( health : get ()) end ) -- You can format it as text and put it in some UI, too. local myText = New \"TextLabel\" { Text = Computed ( function () return \"Health: \" .. wholeHealth : get () end ) } You can even configure your animations using state objects, too. This makes it easy to swap out animations or disable them when needed. -- Define some tweening styles... local TWEEN_FAST = TweenInfo . new ( 0.5 , Enum . EasingStyle . Elastic ) local TWEEN_SLOW = TweenInfo . new ( 2 , Enum . EasingStyle . Sine ) -- Choose more dramatic styles at low health... local style = Computed ( function () return if health : get () < 20 then TWEEN_FAST else TWEEN_SLOW end ) -- Plug it right into your animation! local tweenHealth = Tween ( health , style ) Sparked your curiosity? \u00b6 Those are the core features of Fusion, and they're the foundation of everything - whether it\u2019s complex 3D UI systems, procedural animation, or just a hello world app. It all fits on one page, and that's the magic. You don't have to keep relearning ever-more-complex tools as you scale up from prototype to product.

This is used to uniquely identify what kind of error or message you're seeing. Use the search box below to paste in or type an error ID, and it will scroll to the details for you. callbackError \u00b6 Error in callback: attempt to perform arithmetic (add) on number and string Thrown by: Computed , ForKeys , ForValues , ForPairs , Contextual Fusion ran a function you specified, but the function threw an error that Fusion couldn't handle. The error includes a more specific message which can be used to diagnose the issue. cannotAssignProperty \u00b6 The class type 'Foo' has no assignable property 'Bar'. Thrown by: New , Hydrate You tried to set a property on an instance, but the property can't be assigned to for some reason. This could be because the property doesn't exist, or because it's locked by Roblox to prevent edits. Check your privileges Different scripts may have different privileges - for example, plugins will be allowed more privileges than in-game scripts. Make sure you have the necessary privileges to assign to your properties! cannotConnectChange \u00b6 The Frame class doesn't have a property called 'Foo'. Thrown by: OnChange You tried to connect to a property change event, but the property you specify doesn't exist on the instance. cannotConnectEvent \u00b6 The Frame class doesn't have an event called 'Foo'. Thrown by: OnEvent You tried to connect to an event on an instance, but the event you specify doesn't exist on the instance. cannotCreateClass \u00b6 Can't create a new instance of class 'EditableImage'. Thrown by: New You attempted to create a type of instance that Fusion can't create. Beta features Some instances are only creatable when you have certain Studio betas enabled. Check your Beta Features tab to ensure that beta features aren't causing the issue. cleanupWasRenamed \u00b6 `Fusion.cleanup` was renamed to `Fusion.doCleanup`. This will be an error in future versions of Fusion. Thrown by: doCleanup You attempted to use cleanup() in Fusion 0.3, which replaces it with the doCleanup() method. destroyedTwice \u00b6 Attempted to destroy Computed twice; ensure you're not manually calling `:destroy()` while using scopes. See discussion #292 on GitHub for advice. Thrown by: Value , Computed , Observer , ForKeys , ForValues , ForPairs , Spring , Tween Related discussions: #292 The :destroy() method of the object in question was called more than once. This usually means you called :destroy() manually, which is almost never required because Fusion's constructors always link objects to scopes . When that scope is passed to doCleanup() , the :destroy() method is called on every object inside. destructorRedundant \u00b6 Computed destructors no longer do anything. If you wish to run code on destroy, `table.insert` a function into the `scope` argument. See discussion #292 on GitHub for advice. Thrown by: Computed , ForKeys , ForValues , ForPairs Related discussions: #292 You passed an extra parameter to the constructor, which has historically been interpreted as a function that runs when a value is cleaned up. This mechanism has been replaced by scopes . forKeyCollision \u00b6 The key '6' was returned multiple times simultaneously, which is not allowed in `For` objects. Thrown by: ForKeys , ForPairs When called with different items from the table, the same key was returned for both of them. This is not allowed, because keys have to be unique in a table. invalidAttributeChangeHandler \u00b6 The change handler for the 'Active' attribute must be a function. Thrown by: AttributeChange AttributeChange expected you to provide a function for it to run when the attribute changes, but you provided something other than a function. For example, you might have accidentally provided nil . invalidAttributeOutType \u00b6 [AttributeOut] properties must be given Value objects. Thrown by: AttributeOut AttributeOut expected you to give it a value , but you gave it something else. invalidChangeHandler \u00b6 The change handler for the 'AbsoluteSize' property must be a function. Thrown by: OnChange OnChange expected you to provide a function for it to run when the property changes, but you provided something other than a function. For example, you might have accidentally provided nil . invalidEventHandler \u00b6 The handler for the 'MouseEnter' event must be a function. Thrown by: OnEvent OnEvent expected you to provide a function for it to run when the event is fired, but you provided something other than a function. For example, you might have accidentally provided nil . invalidOutProperty \u00b6 The Frame class doesn't have a property called 'MouseButton1Down'. Thrown by: Out The property that you tried to output doesn't exist on the instance that Out was used with. invalidOutType \u00b6 [Out] properties must be given Value objects. Thrown by: Out Out expected you to give it a value , but you gave it something else. invalidPropertyType \u00b6 'Frame.BackgroundColor3' expected a 'Color3' type, but got a 'Vector3' type. Thrown by: New , Hydrate You attempted to assign a value to a Roblox instance's property, but the assignment threw an error because that property doesn't accept values of that type. invalidRefType \u00b6 Instance refs must be Value objects. Thrown by: Ref Ref expected you to give it a value , but you gave it something else. invalidSpringDamping \u00b6 The damping ratio for a spring must be >= 0. (damping was -1.00) Thrown by: Spring You provided a damping ratio that the spring doesn't support, for example NaN , or a negative damping implying negative friction. invalidSpringSpeed \u00b6 The speed of a spring must be >= 0. (speed was NaN) Thrown by: Spring You provided a speed multiplier that the spring doesn't support, for example NaN or a negative speed implying the spring moves backwards through time. mergeConflict \u00b6 Multiple definitions for 'Observer' found while merging. Thrown by: scoped Fusion tried to merge together multiple tables, but a key was found in more than one of the tables, and it's unclear which one you intended to have in the final merged result. This can happen subtly with methods such as scoped() which automatically merge together all of their arguments. mistypedSpringDamping \u00b6 The damping ratio for a spring must be a number. (got a string) Thrown by: Spring You provided a damping ratio that the spring couldn't understand. Damping ratio has to be a number. mistypedSpringSpeed \u00b6 The speed of a spring must be a number. (got a string) Thrown by: Spring You provided a speed multiplier that the spring couldn't understand. Speed has to be a number. mistypedTweenInfo \u00b6 The tween info of a tween must be a TweenInfo. (got a table) Thrown by: Tween You provided an easing curve that the tween couldn't understand. The easing curve has to be specified using Roblox's TweenInfo data type. noTaskScheduler \u00b6 Fusion is not connected to an external task scheduler. Fusion depends on a task scheduler being present to perform certain time-related tasks such as deferral, delays, or updating animations. You'll need to define a set of standard task scheduler functions that Fusion can use for those purposes. Roblox users should never see this error, as Fusion automatically connects to Roblox's task scheduling APIs. possiblyOutlives \u00b6 The Value object could be destroyed before the Computed that is use()-ing it; review the order they're created in, and what scopes they belong to. See discussion #292 on GitHub for advice. Thrown by: Spring , Tween , New , Hydrate , Attribute , AttributeOut , Out , Ref , Computed , Observer Related discussions: #292 If you use an object after it's been destroyed, then your code can break. This mainly happens when one object 'outlives' another object that it's using. Because scopes clean up the newest objects first, this can happen when an old object depends on something much newer that itself. During cleanup, a situation could arise where the newer object is destroyed, then the older object runs code of some kind that needed the newer object to be there. Fusion can check for situations like this by analysing the scopes. This message is shown when Fusion can prove one of these situations will occur. There are two typical solutions: If the objects should always be created and destroyed at the exact same time, then ensure they're created in the correct order. Otherwise, move the objects into separate scopes, and ensure that both scopes can exist without the other scope. propertySetError \u00b6 Error setting property: UIAspectRatioConstraint.AspectRatio set to a non-positive value. Value must be a positive. Thrown by: New , Hydrate You attempted to set a property, but Roblox threw an error in response. The error includes a more specific message which can be used to diagnose the issue. scopeMissing \u00b6 To create Observers, provide a scope. (e.g. `myScope:Observer(watching)`). See discussion #292 on GitHub for advice. Thrown by: New , Hydrate , Value , Computed , Observer , ForKeys , ForValues , ForPairs , Spring , Tween Related discussions: #292 You attempted to create an object without providing a scope as the first parameter. Scopes are mandatory for all Fusion constructors so that Fusion knows when the object should be destroyed. springNanGoal \u00b6 A spring was given a NaN goal, so some simulation has been skipped. Ensure no springs have NaN goals. Thrown by: Spring The goal parameter given to the spring during construction contained one or more NaN values. This typically occurs when zero is accidentally divided by zero, or some other invalid mathematical operation has occurred. Check that your code is free of maths errors, and handles all edge cases. springNanMotion \u00b6 A spring encountered NaN during motion, so has snapped to the goal position. Ensure no springs have NaN positions or velocities. Thrown by: Spring While calculating updated position and velocity, one or both of those values ended up as NaN. This typically occurs when zero is accidentally divided by zero, or some other invalid mathematical operation has occurred. Check that your code is free of maths errors, and handles all edge cases. springTypeMismatch \u00b6 The type 'Vector3' doesn't match the spring's type 'Color3'. Thrown by: Spring The spring expected you to provide a type matching the data type that the spring is currently outputting. However, you provided a different data type. stateGetWasRemoved \u00b6 `StateObject:get()` has been replaced by `use()` and `peek()` - see discussion #217 on GitHub. Thrown by: Value , Computed , ForKeys , ForValues , ForPairs , Spring , Tween Related discussions: #217 Older versions of Fusion let you call :get() directly on state objects to read their current value and attempt to infer dependencies. This has been replaced by use functions in Fusion 0.3 for more predictable behaviour and better support for constant values. unknownMessage \u00b6 Unknown error: attempt to call a nil value Fusion ran into a problem, but couldn't associate it with a valid type of error. This is a fallback error type which shouldn't be seen by end users, because it indicates that Fusion code isn't reporting errors correctly. unrecognisedChildType \u00b6 'string' type children aren't accepted by `[Children]`. Thrown by: Children You provided a value inside of [Children] which didn't meet the definition of a child value. Check that you're only passing instances, arrays and state objects. unrecognisedPropertyKey \u00b6 'number' keys aren't accepted in property tables. Thrown by: New , Hydrate You provided something other than a property assignment ( Property = Value ) or special key in your property table. Most commonly, this means you tried to add child instances directly into the property table, rather than passing them into the [Children] special key. unrecognisedPropertyStage \u00b6 'children' isn't a valid stage for a special key to be applied at. Thrown by: New , Hydrate You attempted to use a special key which has a misconfigured stage , so Fusion didn't know when to apply it during instance construction. useAfterDestroy \u00b6 The Value object is no longer valid - it was destroyed before the Computed that is use()-ing. See discussion #292 on GitHub for advice. Thrown by: Spring , Tween , New , Hydrate , Attribute , AttributeOut , Out , Ref , Computed , Observer Related discussions: #292 Your code attempted to access an object after that object was destroyed, either because its :destroy() method was called manually, or because the object's scope was cleaned up.

This container then reparents itself as it gets dragged around between different containers. The Draggable component implements everything necessary to make a seamlessly re-parentable container. type DragInfo = { id : string , mouseOffset : Vector2 -- relative to the dragged item } local function Draggable ( scope : Fusion . Scope < typeof ( Fusion ) > , props : { ID : string , Name : UsedAs < string > ? , Parent : UsedAs < Instance ? > , Layout : { LayoutOrder : UsedAs < number > ? , Position : UsedAs < UDim2 > ? , AnchorPoint : UsedAs < Vector2 > ? , ZIndex : UsedAs < number > ? , Size : UsedAs < UDim2 > ? , OutAbsolutePosition : Fusion . Value < Vector2 > ? , }, Dragging : { MousePosition : UsedAs < Vector2 > , SelfDragInfo : UsedAs < DragInfo ? > , OverlayFrame : UsedAs < Instance ? > } [ typeof ( Children )]: Fusion . Child } ): Fusion . Child By default, Draggable behaves like a regular Frame, parenting itself to the Parent property and applying its Layout properties. It only behaves specially when Dragging.SelfDragInfo is provided. Firstly, it reparents itself to Dragging.OverlayFrame , so it can be seen in front of other UI. Parent = scope : Computed ( function ( use ) return if use ( props . Dragging . SelfDragInfo ) ~= nil then use ( props . Dragging . OverlayFrame ) else use ( props . Parent ) end ), Because of this reparenting, Draggable has to do some extra work to keep the size consistent; it manually calculates the size based on the size of Parent , so it doesn't change size when moved to Dragging.OverlayFrame . -- Calculated manually so the Scale can be set relative to -- `props.Parent` at all times, rather than the `Parent` of this Frame. Size = scope : Computed ( function ( use ) local udim2 = use ( props . Layout . Size ) or UDim2 . fromOffset ( 0 , 0 ) local parentSize = use ( parentSize ) or Vector2 . zero return UDim2 . fromOffset ( udim2 . X . Scale * parentSize . X + udim2 . X . Offset , udim2 . Y . Scale * parentSize . Y + udim2 . Y . Offset ) end ), The Draggable also needs to snap to the mouse cursor, so it can be moved by the user. Ideally, the mouse would stay fixed in position relative to the Draggable , so there are no abrupt changes in the position of any elements. As part of Dragging.SelfDragInfo , a mouseOffset is provided, which describes how far the mouse should stay from the top-left corner. So, when setting the position of the Draggable , that offset can be applied to keep the UI fixed in position relative to the mouse. Position = scope : Computed ( function ( use ) local dragInfo = use ( props . Dragging . SelfDragInfo ) if dragInfo == nil then return use ( props . Layout . Position ) or UDim2 . fromOffset ( 0 , 0 ) else local mousePos = use ( props . Dragging . MousePosition ) local topLeftCorner = mousePos - dragInfo . mouseOffset return UDim2 . fromOffset ( topLeftCorner . X , topLeftCorner . Y ) end end ), This is all that's needed to make a generic container that can seamlessly move between distinct parts of the UI. The rest of the example demonstrates how this can be integrated into real world UI. The example creates a list of TodoItem objects, each with a unique ID, text message, and completion status. Because we don't expect the ID or text to change, they're just constant values. However, the completion status is expected to change, so that's specified to be a Value object. type TodoItem = { id : string , text : string , completed : Fusion . Value < boolean > } local todoItems : Fusion . Value < TodoItem > = { { id = newUniqueID (), text = \"Wake up today\" , completed = Value ( true ) }, { id = newUniqueID (), text = \"Read the Fusion docs\" , completed = Value ( true ) }, { id = newUniqueID (), text = \"Take over the universe\" , completed = Value ( false ) } } The TodoEntry component is meant to represent one individual TodoItem . local function TodoEntry ( scope : Fusion . Scope < typeof ( Fusion ) > , props : { Item : TodoItem , Parent : UsedAs < Instance ? > , Layout : { LayoutOrder : UsedAs < number > ? , Position : UsedAs < UDim2 > ? , AnchorPoint : UsedAs < Vector2 > ? , ZIndex : UsedAs < number > ? , Size : UsedAs < UDim2 > ? , OutAbsolutePosition : Fusion . Value < Vector2 > ? , }, Dragging : { MousePosition : UsedAs < Vector2 > , SelfDragInfo : UsedAs < CurrentlyDragging ? > , OverlayFrame : UsedAs < Instance > ? }, OnMouseDown : () -> () ? } ): Fusion . Child Notice that it shares many of the same property groups as Draggable - these can be passed directly through. return scope : Draggable { ID = props . Item . id , Name = props . Item . text , Parent = props . Parent , Layout = props . Layout , Dragging = props . Dragging , It also provides an OnMouseDown callback, which can be used to pick up the entry if the mouse is pressed down above the entry. Note the comment about why it is not desirable to detect mouse-up here; the UI should unconditionally respond to mouse-up, even if the mouse happens to briefly leave this element. [ OnEvent \"MouseButton1Down\" ] = props . OnMouseDown -- Don't detect mouse up here, because in some rare cases, the event -- could be missed due to lag between the item's position and the -- cursor position. Now, the destinations for these entries can be created. To help decide where to drop items later, the dropAction tracks which destination the mouse is hovered over. local dropAction = scope : Value ( nil ) local taskLists = scope : ForPairs ( { incomplete = \"mark-as-incomplete\" , completed = \"mark-as-completed\" }, function ( use , scope , listName , listDropAction ) return listName , scope : New \"ScrollingFrame\" { Name = ` TaskList ({ listName }) ` , Position = UDim2 . fromScale ( 0.1 , 0.1 ), Size = UDim2 . fromScale ( 0.35 , 0.9 ), BackgroundTransparency = 0.75 , BackgroundColor3 = Color3 . new ( 1 , 0 , 0 ), [ OnEvent \"MouseEnter\" ] = function () dropAction : set ( listDropAction ) end , [ OnEvent \"MouseLeave\" ] = function () -- A different item might have overwritten this already. if peek ( dropAction ) == listDropAction then dropAction : set ( nil ) end end , [ Children ] = { New \"UIListLayout\" { SortOrder = \"Name\" , Padding = UDim . new ( 0 , 5 ) } } } end ) This is also where the 'overlay frame' is created, which gives currently-dragged UI a dedicated layer above all other UI to freely move around. local overlayFrame = scope : New \"Frame\" { Size = UDim2 . fromScale ( 1 , 1 ), ZIndex = 10 , BackgroundTransparency = 1 } Finally, each TodoItem is created as a TodoEntry . Some state is also created to track which entry is being dragged at the moment. local currentlyDragging : Fusion . Value < DragInfo ? > = scope : Value ( nil ) local allEntries = scope : ForValues ( todoItems , function ( use , scope , item ) local itemPosition = scope : Value ( nil ) return scope : TodoEntry { Item = item , Each entry dynamically picks one of the two destinations based on its completion status. Parent = scope : Computed ( function ( use ) return if use ( item . completed ) then use ( taskLists ). completed else use ( taskLists ). incomplete end ), It also provides the information needed by the Draggable . Note that the current drag information is filtered from the currentlyDragging state so the Draggable won't see information about other entries being dragged. Dragging = { MousePosition = mousePos , SelfDragInfo = scope : Computed ( function ( use ) local dragInfo = use ( currentlyDragging ) return if dragInfo == nil or dragInfo . id ~= item . id then nil else dragInfo end ) OverlayFrame = overlayFrame }, Now it's time to handle starting and stopping the drag. To begin the drag, this code makes use of the OnMouseDown callback. If nothing else is being dragged right now, the position of the mouse relative to the item is captured. Then, that mouseOffset and the id of the item are passed into the currentlyDragging state to indicate this entry is being dragged. OnMouseDown = function () if peek ( currentlyDragging ) == nil then local itemPos = peek ( itemPosition ) or Vector2 . zero local mouseOffset = peek ( mousePos ) - itemPos currentlyDragging : set ({ id = item . id , mouseOffset = mouseOffset }) end end To end the drag, a global InputEnded listener is created, which should reliably fire no matter where or when the event occurs. If there's a dropAction to take, for example mark-as-completed , then that action is executed here. In all cases, currentlyDragging is cleared, so the entry is no longer dragged. table.insert ( scope , UserInputService . InputEnded : Connect ( function ( inputObject ) if inputObject . UserInputType ~= Enum . UserInputType . MouseButton1 then return end local dragInfo = peek ( currentlyDragging ) if dragInfo == nil then return end local item = getTodoItemForID ( dragInfo . id ) local action = peek ( dropAction ) if item ~= nil then if action == \"mark-as-incomplete\" then item . completed : set ( false ) elseif action == \"mark-as-completed\" then item . completed : set ( true ) end end currentlyDragging : set ( nil ) end ) ) All that remains is to parent the task lists and overlay frames to a UI, so they can be seen. Because the TodoEntry component manages their own parent, this code shouldn't pass in allEntries as a child here. local ui = scope : New \"ScreenGui\" { Parent = Players . LocalPlayer : FindFirstChildOfClass ( \"PlayerGui\" ) [ Children ] = { overlayFrame , taskLists , -- Don't pass `allEntries` in here - they manage their own parent! } }","title":"Drag & Drop"},{"location":"examples/cookbook/drag-and-drop/#explanation","text":"The basic idea is to create a container which stores the UI you want to drag.

OnMouseDown = function () if peek ( currentlyDragging ) == nil then local itemPos = peek ( itemPosition ) or Vector2 . zero local mouseOffset = peek ( mousePos ) - itemPos currentlyDragging : set ({ id = item . id , mouseOffset = mouseOffset }) end end To end the drag, a global InputEnded listener is created, which should reliably fire no matter where or when the event occurs. If there's a dropAction to take, for example mark-as-completed , then that action is executed here. In all cases, currentlyDragging is cleared, so the entry is no longer dragged. table.insert ( scope , UserInputService . InputEnded : Connect ( function ( inputObject ) if inputObject . UserInputType ~= Enum . UserInputType . MouseButton1 then return end local dragInfo = peek ( currentlyDragging ) if dragInfo == nil then return end local item = getTodoItemForID ( dragInfo . id ) local action = peek ( dropAction ) if item ~= nil then if action == \"mark-as-incomplete\" then item . completed : set ( false ) elseif action == \"mark-as-completed\" then item . completed : set ( true ) end end currentlyDragging : set ( nil ) end ) ) All that remains is to parent the task lists and overlay frames to a UI, so they can be seen. Because the TodoEntry component manages their own parent, this code shouldn't pass in allEntries as a child here. local ui = scope : New \"ScreenGui\" { Parent = Players . LocalPlayer : FindFirstChildOfClass ( \"PlayerGui\" ) [ Children ] = { overlayFrame , taskLists , -- Don't pass `allEntries` in here - they manage their own parent! } }","title":"Explanation"},{"location":"examples/cookbook/fetch-data-from-server/","text":"This code shows how to deal with yielding/blocking code, such as fetching data from a server.

Please don't use them to represent things that are not Fusion; for example, if you build your own UI library, it's better to design a new logo. In general, prefer to keep some distance between your project branding and Fusion's branding, enough distance that people don't get confused about who makes what, or whether a project is officially supported or not. It's a good litmus test to imagine a first-time user who knows nothing about Fusion, and how they will perceive your project. Don't do this In this example, someone made their own UI library and named it Fusion 2. Note that this is an extreme example for demonstration purposes - most violations of this principle are probably more subtle. This is bad because people might mistakenly think the official Fusion project approves or provides support for this unrelated project, which would cause many headaches and is dishonest about the relationship between the two libraries. Plus, in this example, we reserve the right to update Fusion to version 2 at any time, which would immediately cause a naming conflict. Instead, do this This logo makes it more clear that the project is not a port of, update to or bindings for the Fusion library. Instead, it's a completely distinct project which only takes inspiration from Fusion, but is otherwise unrelated. It's okay for the logo to remind people of Fusion's design. Remember - you don't have to be completely original, just distinct enough that it isn't confusing for people.

Here, you'll learn how to build great things with Fusion, even if you're a complete newcomer to the library. You'll not only learn how Fusion's features work, but you'll also be presented with wisdom from those who've worked with some of the largest Fusion codebases today. But first, some advice from the maintainers... Fusion is pre-1.0 software. We (the maintainers and contributors) work hard to keep releases bug-free and relatively complete, so it should be safe to use in production. Many people already do, and report fantastic results! However, we mark Fusion as pre-1.0 because we are working on the design of the library itself. We strive for the best library design we can deliver, which means breaking changes are common and sweeping. With Fusion, you should expect: upgrades to be frictionful, requiring code to be rethought features to be superseded or removed across versions advice or best practices to change over time You should also expect: careful consideration around breakage, even though we reserve the right to do it clear communication ahead of any major changes helpful advice to answer your questions and ease your porting process We hope you enjoy using Fusion! What You Need To Know \u00b6 These tutorials assume: That you're comfortable with the Luau scripting language. These tutorials aren't an introduction to Luau! If you'd like to learn, check out the Roblox documentation . That - if you're using Roblox features - you're familiar with how Roblox works. You don't have to be an expert! Knowing about basic instances, events and data types will be good enough. Based on your existing knowledge, you may find some tutorials easier or harder. Don't be discouraged - Fusion's built to be easy to learn, but it may still take a bit of time to absorb some concepts. Learn at a pace which is right for you. Installing Fusion \u00b6 There are two ways of installing Fusion, dependent on your use case. If you are creating Luau experiences in Roblox Studio, then you can import a Roblox model file containing Fusion. Steps (click to expand) Head over to Fusion's 'Releases' page . Click the 'Assets' dropdown to view the downloadable files: Now, click on the Fusion.rbxm file to download it. This model contains Fusion. Head into Roblox Studio to import the model; if you're just following the tutorials, an empty baseplate will do. Right-click on ReplicatedStorage , and select 'Insert from File': Select the Fusion.rbxm file you just downloaded. You should see a 'Fusion' module script appear in ReplicatedStorage ! Now, you can create a script for testing: Create a LocalScript in StarterGui or StarterPlayerScripts . Remove the default code, and paste the following code in: 1 2 local ReplicatedStorage = game : GetService ( \"ReplicatedStorage\" ) local Fusion = require ( ReplicatedStorage . Fusion ) Press 'Play' - if there are no errors, everything was set up correctly!. If you're using pure Luau, or if you're synchronising external files into Roblox Studio, then you can use Fusion's source code directly. Steps (click to expand) Head over to Fusion's 'Releases' page . Under 'Assets', download Source code (zip) . Inside is a copy of the Fusion GitHub repository. Inside the zip, copy the src folder - it may be inside another folder. Paste the src folder into your local project, wherever you keep your libraries (e.g. inside a lib or shared folder) Rename the pasted folder from src to Fusion . Once everything is set up, you should be able to require() Fusion in one of the following ways: -- Rojo local Fusion = require ( ReplicatedStorage . Fusion ) -- darklua local Fusion = require ( \"../shared/Fusion\" ) -- vanilla Luau local Fusion = require ( \"../shared/Fusion/init.lua\" ) Getting Help \u00b6 Fusion is built to be easy to use, and this website strives to be as useful and comprehensive as possible. However, you might need targeted help on a specific issue, or you might want to grow your understanding of Fusion in other ways. The best place to get help is the #fusion channel over on the Roblox OSS Discord server . Maintainers and contributors drop in frequently, alongside many eager Fusion users. For bugs and feature requests, open an issue on GitHub.","title":"Get Started"},{"location":"tutorials/#what-you-need-to-know","text":"These tutorials assume: That you're comfortable with the Luau scripting language.

This can be used for 'springy' effects, or for smoothing out movement naturally without abrupt changes in direction. Usage \u00b6 To create a new spring object, call scope:Spring() and pass it a state object to move towards: local goal = scope : Value ( 0 ) local animated = scope : Spring ( goal ) The spring will smoothly follow the 'goal' state object over time. As with other state objects, you can peek() at its value at any time: print ( peek ( animated )) --> 0.26425... To configure how the spring moves, you can provide a speed and damping ratio to use. Both are optional, and both can be state objects if desired: local goal = scope : Value ( 0 ) local speed = 25 local damping = scope : Value ( 0.5 ) local animated = scope : Spring ( goal , speed , damping ) You can also set the position and velocity of the spring at any time. animated : setPosition ( 5 ) -- teleport the spring to 5 animated : setVelocity ( 2 ) -- from here, move 2 units/second You can use many different kinds of values with springs, not just numbers.

Lower values allow the spring to move freely and oscillate up and down, while higher values restrict movement. Zero damping \u00b6 Zero damping means no friction is applied, so the spring will oscillate forever without losing energy. This is generally not useful. Underdamping \u00b6 A damping between 0 and 1 means some friction is applied. The spring will still oscillate, but it will lose energy and eventually settle at the goal. Critical damping \u00b6 A damping of exactly 1 means just enough friction is applied to stop the spring from oscillating. It reaches its goal as quickly as possible without going past. This is also commonly known as critical damping. Overdamping \u00b6 A damping above 1 applies excessive friction to the spring. The spring behaves like it's moving through honey, glue or some other viscous fluid. Overdamping reduces the effect of velocity changes, and makes movement more rigid. Speed \u00b6 The speed of the spring scales how much time it takes for the spring to move. Doubling the speed makes it move twice as fast; halving the speed makes it move twice as slow. Interruption \u00b6 Springs do not share the same interruption problems as tweens. When the goal changes, springs are guaranteed to preserve both position and velocity, reducing jank: This also means springs are suitable for following rapidly changing values:","title":"Springs"},{"location":"tutorials/animation/springs/#usage","text":"To create a new spring object, call scope:Spring() and pass it a state object to move towards: local goal = scope : Value ( 0 ) local animated = scope : Spring ( goal ) The spring will smoothly follow the 'goal' state object over time.

This can be used for basic, predictable animations. Usage \u00b6 To create a new tween object, call scope:Tween() and pass it a state object to move towards: local goal = scope : Value ( 0 ) local animated = scope : Tween ( goal ) The tween will smoothly follow the 'goal' state object over time. As with other state objects, you can peek() at its value at any time: print ( peek ( animated )) --> 0.26425... To configure how the tween moves, you can provide a TweenInfo to change the shape of the animation curve.

EasingStyle . Quad )) Time \u00b6 The first parameter of TweenInfo is time. This specifies how long it should take for the value to animate to the goal, in seconds. Easing Style \u00b6 The second parameter of TweenInfo is easing style. By setting this to various Enum.EasingStyle values, you can select different pre-made animation curves. Easing Direction \u00b6 The third parameter of TweenInfo is easing direction. This can be set to one of three values to control how the tween starts and stops: Enum.EasingDirection.Out makes the tween animate out smoothly. Enum.EasingDirection.In makes the tween animate in smoothly. Enum.EasingDirection.InOut makes the tween animate in and out smoothly. Repeats \u00b6 The fourth parameter of TweenInfo is repeat count. This can be used to loop the animation a number of times. Setting the repeat count to a negative number causes it to loop infinitely. This is not generally useful for transition animations. Reversing \u00b6 The fifth parameter of TweenInfo is a reversing option. When enabled, the animation will return to the starting point. This is not typically useful because the animation doesn't end at the goal value, and might not end at the start value either if the animation is interrupted. Delay \u00b6 The sixth and final parameter of TweenInfo is delay. Increasing this delay adds empty space before the beginning of the animation curve. It's important to note this is not the same as a true delay. This option does not delay the input signal - it only makes the tween animation longer. Interruption \u00b6 Because tweens are built from pre-made, fixed animation curves, you should avoid interrupting those animation curves before they're finished. Interrupting a tween halfway through leads to abrupt changes in velocity, which can cause your animation to feel janky: Tweens also can't track constantly changing targets very well. That's because the tween is always getting interrupted as it gets started, so it never has time to play out much of its animation. These issues arise because tweens don't 'remember' their previous velocity when they start animating towards a new goal. If you need velocity to be remembered, it's a much better idea to use springs, which can preserve their momentum.","title":"Tweens"},{"location":"tutorials/animation/tweens/#usage","text":"To create a new tween object, call scope:Tween() and pass it a state object to move towards: local goal = scope : Value ( 0 ) local animated = scope : Tween ( goal ) The tween will smoothly follow the 'goal' state object over time.

This is called top-down control, and is the primary flow of control in Fusion. However, sometimes components need to talk back to their controlling code, for example to report when button clicks occur. In Luau \u00b6 Callbacks are functions which you pass into other functions. They're useful because they allow the function to 'call back' into your code, so your code can do something in response: local function printMessage () print ( \"Hello, world!\" ) end -- Here, we're passing `printMessage` as a callback -- `task.delay` will call it after 5 seconds task . delay ( 5 , printMessage ) If your function accepts a callback, then you can call it like any other function. Luau will execute the function, then return to your code. In this example, the fiveTimes function calls a callback five times: Luau code Output local function fiveTimes ( callback : ( number ) -> () ) for x = 1 , 5 do callback ( x ) end end fiveTimes ( function ( num ) print ( \"The number is\" , num ) end ) The number is 1 The number is 2 The number is 3 The number is 4 The number is 5 In Fusion \u00b6 Components can use callbacks the same way. Consider this button component; when the button is clicked, the button needs to run some external code: local function Button ( scope : Fusion .

In the world of UI, you may think of them as components - though they can be used for much more than just UI. For example, consider this function, which generates a button based on some props the user passes in: type UsedAs < T > = Fusion . UsedAs < T > local function Button ( scope : Fusion . Scope < typeof ( Fusion ) > , props : { Position : UsedAs < UDim2 > ? , AnchorPoint : UsedAs < Vector2 > ? , Size : UsedAs < UDim2 > ? , LayoutOrder : UsedAs < number > ? , ButtonText : UsedAs < string > } ) return scope : New \"TextButton\" { BackgroundColor3 = Color3 . new ( 0 , 0.25 , 1 ), Position = props .

Parent = Players . LocalPlayer . PlayerGui . ScreenGui This is the primary way of writing components in Fusion. You create functions that accept scope and props , then return some content from them. Properties \u00b6 If you don't say what props should contain, it might be hard to figure out how to use it. You can specify your list of properties by adding a type to props , which gives you useful autocomplete and type checking. local function Cake ( -- ... some stuff here ... props : { Size : Vector3 , Colour : Color3 , IsTasty : boolean } ) -- ... some other stuff here ... end Note that the above code only accepts constant values, not state objects. If you want to accept either a constant or a state object, you can use the UsedAs type. type UsedAs < T > = Fusion . UsedAs < T > local function Cake ( -- ... some stuff here ... props : { Size : UsedAs < Vector3 > , Colour : UsedAs < Color3 > , IsTasty : UsedAs < boolean > } ) -- ... some other stuff here ... end This is usually what you want, because it means the user can easily switch a property to dynamically change over time, while still writing properties normally when they don't change over time. You can mostly treat UsedAs properties like they're state objects, because functions like peek() and use() automatically choose the right behaviour for you. You can use the rest of Luau's type checking features to do more complex things, like making certain properties optional, or restricting that values are valid for a given property. Go wild! Be mindful of the angle brackets Remember that, when working with UsedAs , you should be mindful of whether you're putting things inside the angled brackets, or outside of them. Putting some things inside of the angle brackets can change their meaning, compared to putting them outside of the angle brackets. Consider these two type definitions carefully: -- A Vector3, or a state object storing Vector3, or nil. UsedAs < Vector3 > ? -- A Vector3?, or a state object storing Vector3? UsedAs < Vector3 ? > The first type is best for optional properties , where you provide a default value if it isn't specified by the user. If the user does specify it, they're forced to always give a valid value for it. The second type is best if the property understands nil as a valid value. This means the user can set it to nil at any time. Scopes \u00b6 In addition to props , you should also ask for a scope . The scope parameter should come first, so that your users can use scoped() syntax to create it. -- barebones syntax local thing = Component ( scope , { -- ... some properties here ... }) -- scoped() syntax local thing = scope : Component { -- ... some properties here ... } It's a good idea to provide a type for scope . This lets you specify what methods you need the scope to have. scope : Fusion . Scope < YourMethodsHere > If you don't know what methods to ask for, consider these two strategies. If you use common methods (like Fusion's constructors) then it's a safe assumption that the user will also have those methods. You can ask for a scope with those methods pre-defined. local function Component ( scope : Fusion . Scope < typeof ( Fusion ) > , props : {} ) return scope : New \"Thing\" { -- ... rest of code here ... } end If you need more specific or niche things that the user likely won't have (for example, components you use internally), then you should not ask for those. Instead, create a new inner scope with the methods you need. local function Component ( scope : Fusion .

There's a number of advantages to this: it's easier to find the source code for a specific component it keep each file shorter and simpler it makes sure components are properly independent, and can't interfere it encourages reusing components everywhere, not just in one file Here's an example of how you could split up some components into modules: Main file PopUp Message Button 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 local Fusion = require ( game : GetService ( \"ReplicatedStorage\" ).

To help achieve the best performance, you can give Fusion more information about what you're trying to do, or avoid a few problematic scenarios that slow Fusion down. Update Skipping \u00b6 Fusion tries to skip updates when they result in 'meaningless changes'. TL;DR When your computations return values that aren't meaningfully different, Fusion doesn't bother to perform further updates. However, Fusion can't automatically do this for tables. So, you should freeze every table you create, unless you need to change what's inside the table later (for example, if it's a list that changes over time). This allows Fusion to apply more aggressive optimisations for free. Example \u00b6 Imagine you have a number, and you're using a computed to calculate whether it's even or odd. An observer is used to see how often this results in other code being run. Luau code Output local number = scope : Value ( 1 ) local isEven = scope : Computed ( function ( use ) return use ( number ) % 2 == 0 end ) scope : Observer ( isEven ): onChange ( function () print ( \"-> isEven has changed to \" .. peek ( isEven )) end ) print ( \"Number becomes 2\" ) number : set ( 2 ) print ( \"Number becomes 3\" ) number : set ( 3 ) print ( \"Number becomes 13\" ) number : set ( 13 ) print ( \"Number becomes 14\" ) number : set ( 14 ) print ( \"Number becomes 24\" ) number : set ( 24 ) Number becomes 2 -> isEven has changed to true Number becomes 3 -> isEven has changed to false Number becomes 13 Number becomes 14 -> isEven has changed to true Number becomes 24 Notice that the observer only runs when isEven returns a meaningfully different value: When the number changed from 2 to 3, isEven returned false . This is meaningfully different from the previous value of isEven , which was true . As a result, the observer is run and the printed message is seen. When the number changed from 3 to 13, isEven returned false . This is not meaningfully different from the previous value of isEven , which was false . As a result, the observer does not run, and no printed message is seen. Similarity \u00b6 When trying to determine if a change is 'meaningless', Fusion compares the old and new values, using what's called the similarity test . The similarity test is a fast, approximate test that Fusion uses to guess which updates it can safely discard. If two values pass the similarity test, then you should be able to use them interchangeably without affecting most Luau code. In Fusion's case, if the values before and after a change are similar, then Fusion won't continue updating other code beyond that change, because those updates aren't likely to have an effect on the outcome of computations. Here's what the similarity test looks for: Different types: Two values of different types are never similar to each other. Tables: Frozen tables are similar to other values when they're == to each other. Tables with a metatable are similar to other values when when they're == to each other. Other kinds of table are never similar to anything. Userdatas: Userdatas are similar to other values when they're == to each other. NaN: If each value does not == itself, then the two values are similar to each other. This doesn't apply to tables or userdatas. Any other values: Two values are similar to each other when they're == to each other. Roblox data types Roblox data types are not considered to be userdatas. Instead, the similarity test follows typeof() rules when determining type. Optimising For Similarity \u00b6 With this knowledge about the similarity test, you can experiment with how Fusion optimises different changes, and what breaks that optimisation. Tables \u00b6 Imagine you're setting a value object to a table of theme colours. You attach an observer object to see when Fusion thinks the theme meaningfully changed. Luau code Output local LIGHT_THEME = { name = \"light\" , -- imagine theme colours in here } local DARK_THEME = { name = \"dark\" , -- imagine theme colours in here } local currentTheme = scope : Value ( LIGHT_THEME ) scope : Observer ( currentTheme ): onChange ( function () print ( \"-> currentTheme changed to \" .. peek ( currentTheme ). name ) end ) print ( \"Set to DARK_THEME\" ) currentTheme : set ( DARK_THEME ) print ( \"Set to DARK_THEME\" ) currentTheme : set ( DARK_THEME ) print ( \"Set to LIGHT_THEME\" ) currentTheme : set ( LIGHT_THEME ) print ( \"Set to LIGHT_THEME\" ) currentTheme : set ( LIGHT_THEME ) Set to DARK_THEME -> currentTheme changed to dark Set to DARK_THEME -> currentTheme changed to dark Set to LIGHT_THEME -> currentTheme changed to light Set to LIGHT_THEME -> currentTheme changed to light Because the LIGHT_THEME and DARK_THEME tables aren't frozen, and they don't have any metatables, Fusion will never skip over updates that change to or from those values. Why won't Fusion skip those updates? In Fusion, it's common to update arrays without creating a new array. This is known as mutating the array. local drinks = scope : Value ({ \"beer\" , \"pepsi\" }) do -- add tea local array = peek ( drinks ) table.insert ( array , \"tea\" ) -- mutation occurs here drinks : set ( array ) -- still the same array, so it's == end If Fusion skipped updates when the old and new values were == , then these mutating changes wouldn't cause an update. For that reason, Fusion doesn't skip updates for tables unless you do one of two things: You disable the ability to mutate the table (via table.freeze ). You indicate to Fusion that this isn't plain data by adding a metatable. Metatables are almost always used for OOP, where == is a sensible way of determining if two objects are similar. You can also use metatables to define how equality should work, which Fusion will respect - though Fusion expects it to be symmetric. According to the similarity test (and the question section above), one way to skip these updates is by freezing the original tables. Luau code Output local LIGHT_THEME = table . freeze { name = \"light\" , -- imagine theme colours in here } local DARK_THEME = table . freeze { name = \"dark\" , -- imagine theme colours in here } local currentTheme = scope : Value ( LIGHT_THEME ) scope : Observer ( currentTheme ): onChange ( function () print ( \"-> currentTheme changed to \" .. peek ( currentTheme ). name ) end ) print ( \"Set to DARK_THEME\" ) currentTheme : set ( DARK_THEME ) print ( \"Set to DARK_THEME\" ) currentTheme : set ( DARK_THEME ) print ( \"Set to LIGHT_THEME\" ) currentTheme : set ( LIGHT_THEME ) print ( \"Set to LIGHT_THEME\" ) currentTheme : set ( LIGHT_THEME ) Set to DARK_THEME -> currentTheme changed to dark Set to DARK_THEME Set to LIGHT_THEME -> currentTheme changed to light Set to LIGHT_THEME Now, Fusion is confident enough to skip over the updates. In general, you should freeze all of your tables when working with Fusion, unless you have a reason for modifying them later on. There's almost zero cost to freezing a table, making this modification essentially free. Plus, this lets Fusion optimise your updates more aggressively, which means you spend less time running computations on average.","title":"Optimisation"},{"location":"tutorials/best-practices/optimisation/#update-skipping","text":"Fusion tries to skip updates when they result in 'meaningless changes'. TL;DR When your computations return values that aren't meaningfully different, Fusion doesn't bother to perform further updates. However, Fusion can't automatically do this for tables. So, you should freeze every table you create, unless you need to change what's inside the table later (for example, if it's a list that changes over time). This allows Fusion to apply more aggressive optimisations for free.","title":"Update Skipping"},{"location":"tutorials/best-practices/optimisation/#example","text":"Imagine you have a number, and you're using a computed to calculate whether it's even or odd.

This is meaningfully different from the previous value of isEven , which was true . As a result, the observer is run and the printed message is seen. When the number changed from 3 to 13, isEven returned false . This is not meaningfully different from the previous value of isEven , which was false . As a result, the observer does not run, and no printed message is seen.","title":"Example"},{"location":"tutorials/best-practices/optimisation/#similarity","text":"When trying to determine if a change is 'meaningless', Fusion compares the old and new values, using what's called the similarity test . The similarity test is a fast, approximate test that Fusion uses to guess which updates it can safely discard. If two values pass the similarity test, then you should be able to use them interchangeably without affecting most Luau code. In Fusion's case, if the values before and after a change are similar, then Fusion won't continue updating other code beyond that change, because those updates aren't likely to have an effect on the outcome of computations. Here's what the similarity test looks for: Different types: Two values of different types are never similar to each other. Tables: Frozen tables are similar to other values when they're == to each other. Tables with a metatable are similar to other values when when they're == to each other. Other kinds of table are never similar to anything. Userdatas: Userdatas are similar to other values when they're == to each other. NaN: If each value does not == itself, then the two values are similar to each other. This doesn't apply to tables or userdatas. Any other values: Two values are similar to each other when they're == to each other. Roblox data types Roblox data types are not considered to be userdatas.

For example, many UI elements might share theme colours for light and dark theme. Globals \u00b6 Typically, values are shared by placing them in modules. These modules can be required from anywhere in the codebase, and their values can be imported into any code. Values shared in this way are known as globals .

Hidden dependencies \u00b6 When you use a global inside a block of reusable code such as a component, you are making your code dependent on another code file without declaring it to the outside world. To some extent, this is entirely why using globals is desirable. While it's more 'correct' to accept the Theme via the parameters of your function, it often means the Theme has to be passed down through multiple layers of functions. This is known as prop drilling and is widely considered bad practice, because it clutters up unrelated code with parameters that are only passed through functions. To avoid prop drilling, globals are often used, which 'hides' the dependency on that external code file. You no longer have to pass it down through parameters. However, relying too heavily on these hidden dependencies can cause your code to behave in surprising, unintuitive ways, or it can obscure what functionality is available to developers using your code. Hard-to-locate writes \u00b6 If you write into globals from deep inside your code base, it becomes very hard to figure out where the global is being changed from, which significantly hurts debugging. Generally, it's best to treat globals as read-only . If you're writing to a global, it should be coming from a single well-signposted, easy-to-find place. You should also keep the principles of top-down control in mind; think of globals as 'flowing down' from the root of the program. Globals are best managed from high up in the program, because they have widespread effects, so consider using callbacks to pass control up the chain, rather than managing globals directly from every part of the code base. Memory management \u00b6 In addition, globals can complicate memory management. Because every part of your code base can access them, you can't destroy globals until the very end of your program. In the above example, this is solved with an init() method which passes the main scope to Theme . Because init() is called before anything else that uses Theme , the objects that Theme creates will be added to the scope first. When the main scope is cleaned up, doCleanup() will destroy things in reverse order. This means the Theme objects will be cleaned up last, after everything else in the program has been cleaned up. This only works if you know that the main script is the only entry point in your program. If you have two scripts running concurrently which try to init() the Theme module, they will overwrite each other. Non-replaceable for testing \u00b6 When your code uses a global, you're hard-coding a connection between your code and that specific global. This is problematic for testing; unless you're using an advanced testing framework with code injection, it's pretty much impossible to separate your code from that global code, which makes it impossible to replace global values for testing purposes. For example, if you wanted to write automated tests that verify light theme and dark theme are correctly applied throughout your UI, you can't replace any values stored in Theme . You might be able to write to the Theme by going through the normal process, but this fundamentally limits how you can test. For example, you couldn't run a test for light theme and dark theme at the same time. Contextuals \u00b6 The main drawback of globals is that they hold one value for all code. To solve this, Fusion introduces contextual values , which can be temporarily changed for the duration of a code block. To create a contextual, call the Contextual function from Fusion. It asks for a default value. local myContextual = Contextual ( \"foo\" ) At any time, you can query its current value using the :now() method. local myContextual = Contextual ( \"foo\" ) print ( myContextual : now ()) --> foo You can override the value for a limited span of time using :is():during() . Pass the temporary value to :is() , and pass a callback to :during() . While the callback is running, the contextual will adopt the temporary value. local myContextual = Contextual ( \"foo\" ) print ( myContextual : now ()) --> foo myContextual : is ( \"bar\" ): during ( function () print ( myContextual : now ()) --> bar end ) print ( myContextual : now ()) --> foo By storing widely-used values inside contextuals, you can isolate different code paths from each other, while retaining the easy, hidden referencing that globals offer. This makes testing and memory management significantly easier, and helps you locate which code is modifying any shared values. To demonstrate, the Theme example can be rewritten to use contextuals.

You're expected to replace the default value with a state object when you want to make the theme dynamic. This has a number of benefits: Because the override is time-limited to one span of your code, you can have multiple scripts running at the same time with completely different overrides. It also explicitly places your code in charge of memory management, because you're creating the object yourself. It's easy to locate where changes are coming from, because you can look for the nearest :is():during() call. Optionally, you could share a limited, read-only version of the value, while retaining private access to write to the value wherever you're overriding the contextual from. Testing becomes much simpler; you can override the contextual for different parts of your testing, without ever having to inject code, and without altering how you read and override the contextual in your production code. It's still possible to run into issues with contextuals, though. You're still hiding a dependency of your code, which can still lead to confusion and obscuring available features, just the same as globals. Unlike globals, contextuals are time-limited. If you connect to an event or start a delayed task, you won't be able to access the value anymore.

This can be useful, but you should be careful when adding state. Creation \u00b6 You can create state objects inside components as you would anywhere else. local HOVER_COLOUR = Color3 . new ( 0.5 , 0.75 , 1 ) local REST_COLOUR = Color3 . new ( 0.25 , 0.5 , 1 ) local function Button ( scope : Fusion .

Top-Down Control \u00b6 Remember that Fusion mainly works with a top-down flow of control. It's a good idea to keep that in mind when adding state to components. When you're making reusable components, it's more flexible if your component can be controlled externally. Components that control themselves entirely are hard to use and customise. Consider the example of a check box. Each check box often reflects a state object under the hood: It might seem logical to store the state object inside the check box, but this causes a few problems: because the state is hidden, it's awkward to read and write from outside often, the user already has a state object representing the same setting, so now there's two state objects where one would have sufficed local function CheckBox ( scope : Fusion . Scope < typeof ( Fusion ) > , props : { -- ... some properties ... } ) local isChecked = scope : Value ( false ) -- problematic return scope : New \"ImageButton\" { [ OnEvent \"Activated\" ] = function () isChecked : set ( not peek ( isChecked )) end , -- ... some more code ... } end A slightly better solution is to pass the state object in. This ensures the controlling code has easy access to the state if it needs it. However, this is not a complete solution: the user is forced to store the state in a Value object, but they might be computing the value dynamically with other state objects instead the behaviour of clicking the check box is hardcoded; the user cannot intercept the click or toggle a different state local function CheckBox ( scope : Fusion . Scope < typeof ( Fusion ) > , props : { IsChecked : Fusion . Value < boolean > -- slightly better } ) return scope : New \"ImageButton\" { [ OnEvent \"Activated\" ] = function () props .

Consider a scenario where you wish to group multiple options under a 'main' check box, so you can turn them all on/off at once. The appearance of that check box would not be controlled by a single state, but instead reflects the combination of multiple states.

Best Practices \u00b6 Those examples lead us to the golden rule of reusable components: Golden Rule Reusable components should reflect program state. They should not control program state. At the bottom of the chain of control, components shouldn't be massively responsible. At these levels, reflective components are easier to work with. As you go up the chain of control, components get broader in scope and less reusable; those places are often suitable for controlling components.

It's a good idea to keep that in mind when adding state to components. When you're making reusable components, it's more flexible if your component can be controlled externally. Components that control themselves entirely are hard to use and customise. Consider the example of a check box. Each check box often reflects a state object under the hood: It might seem logical to store the state object inside the check box, but this causes a few problems: because the state is hidden, it's awkward to read and write from outside often, the user already has a state object representing the same setting, so now there's two state objects where one would have sufficed local function CheckBox ( scope : Fusion .

This ensures the controlling code has easy access to the state if it needs it. However, this is not a complete solution: the user is forced to store the state in a Value object, but they might be computing the value dynamically with other state objects instead the behaviour of clicking the check box is hardcoded; the user cannot intercept the click or toggle a different state local function CheckBox ( scope : Fusion .

That's all there is to scopes. They are arrays of objects which later get passed to a cleanup function. Improved Scopes \u00b6 This syntax is recommended From now on, you'll see this syntax used throughout the tutorials. Fusion can help manage your scopes for you. This unlocks convenient syntax, and allows Fusion to optimise your code. You can call scoped() to obtain a new scope. 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 local Fusion = require ( ReplicatedStorage . Fusion ) local scoped = Fusion . scoped local scope = scoped () local thing1 = Fusion . Value ( scope , \"i am thing 1\" ) local thing2 = Fusion . Value ( scope , \"i am thing 2\" ) local thing3 = Fusion . Value ( scope , \"i am thing 3\" ) Fusion . doCleanup ( scope ) Unlike {} (which always creates a new array), scoped can re-use old arrays. This helps keep your program running smoothly. Beyond making your code more efficient, you can also use scoped for convenient syntax. You can pass a table of functions into scoped : 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 local Fusion = require ( ReplicatedStorage . Fusion ) local scoped = Fusion . scoped local scope = scoped ({ Value = Fusion . Value , doCleanup = Fusion . doCleanup }) local thing1 = Fusion . Value ( scope , \"i am thing 1\" ) local thing2 = Fusion . Value ( scope , \"i am thing 2\" ) local thing3 = Fusion . Value ( scope , \"i am thing 3\" ) Fusion . doCleanup ( scope ) If those functions take scope as their first argument, you can use them as methods directly on the scope: 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 local Fusion = require ( ReplicatedStorage . Fusion ) local scoped = Fusion . scoped local scope = scoped ({ Value = Fusion . Value , doCleanup = Fusion . doCleanup }) local thing1 = scope : Value ( \"i am thing 1\" ) local thing2 = scope : Value ( \"i am thing 2\" ) local thing3 = scope : Value ( \"i am thing 3\" ) scope : doCleanup () This makes it harder to mess up writing scopes. Your code reads more naturally, too. Adding Methods In Bulk \u00b6 Try passing Fusion to scoped() - it's a table with functions, too. local scope = scoped ( Fusion ) -- all still works! local thing1 = scope : Value ( \"i am thing 1\" ) local thing2 = scope : Value ( \"i am thing 2\" ) local thing3 = scope : Value ( \"i am thing 3\" ) scope : doCleanup () This gives you access to all of Fusion's functions without having to import each one manually. If you need to mix in other things, you can pass in another table. local scope = scoped ( Fusion , { Foo = ..., Bar = ... }) You can do this for as many tables as you need. Conflicting names If you pass in two tables that contain things with the same name, scoped() will error. Reusing Methods From Other Scopes \u00b6 Sometimes, you'll want to make a new scope with the same methods as an existing scope. local foo = scoped ({ Foo = Foo , Bar = Bar , Baz = Baz }) -- `bar` should have the same methods as `foo` -- it'd be nice to define this once only... local bar = scoped ({ Foo = Foo , Bar = Bar , Baz = Baz }) print ( foo . Baz == bar . Baz ) --> true bar : doCleanup () foo : doCleanup () To do this, Fusion provides a deriveScope function. It behaves like scoped but lets you skip defining the methods. Instead, you give it an example of what the scope should look like. local foo = scoped ({ Foo = Foo , Bar = Bar , Baz = Baz }) -- `bar` should have the same methods as `foo` -- now, it's only defined once! local bar = foo : deriveScope () print ( foo . Baz == bar . Baz ) --> true bar : doCleanup () foo : doCleanup () Deriving scopes like this is highly efficient because Fusion can re-use the same information for both scopes. It also helps keep your definitions all in one place. You can also add more method tables if you'd like to. local foo = scoped ({ Foo = Foo , Bar = Bar , Baz = Baz }) -- `bar` should have the same methods as `foo` -- now, it's only defined once! local bar = foo : deriveScope ({ Garb = Garb }) print ( bar . Garb ) --> function: 0x123456789abcdef print ( foo . Garb ) --> nil Inner Scopes \u00b6 The main reason you would want to create a new scope is to create things that get destroyed at different times. For example, imagine you're creating a dropdown menu. You create a new scope for the menu, which you clean up when the menu is closed. local uiScope = scoped ( Fusion ) -- ... create the ui ... table.insert ( uiScope , dropdownOpened : Connect ( function () local dropdownScope = uiScope : deriveScope () -- ... create the dropdown ... table.insert ( dropdownScope , dropdownClosed : Connect ( function () dropdownScope : doCleanup () end ) ) end ) ) This ordinarily works just fine; when the dropdown is opened, the new scope is created, and when the dropdown is closed, the new scope is destroyed. However, what if the UI gets cleaned up while the dropdown is open? The uiScope will get cleaned up, but the dropdownScope will not. To help with this, Fusion provides an innerScope method. It works just like deriveScope , but it adds in extra logic: When the original scope is cleaned up, the 'inner scope' is cleaned up too You can still call doCleanup() to clean the inner scope up early local uiScope = scoped ( Fusion ) -- ... create the ui ... table.insert ( uiScope , dropdownOpened : Connect ( function () local dropdownScope = uiScope : innerScope () -- ... create the dropdown ... table.insert ( dropdownScope , dropdownClosed : Connect ( function () dropdownScope : doCleanup () end ) ) end ) ) Now, the dropdown scope is guaranteed to be cleaned up if the UI it came from is cleaned up. This strictly limits how long the dropdown can exist for. Inner scopes are often the safest choice for creating new scopes. They let you call doCleanup whenever you like, but guarantee that they won't stick around beyond the rest of the code they're in. When You'll Use This \u00b6 Scopes might sound like a lot of upfront work. However, you'll find in practice that Fusion manages a lot of this for you, and it makes your code much more resilient to memory leaks and other kinds of memory management issues. You'll need to create and destroy your own scopes manually sometimes. For example, you'll need to create a scope in your main code file to start using Fusion, and you might want to make a few more in other parts of your code. However, Fusion manages most of your scopes for you, so for large parts of your codebase, you won't have to consider scopes and destruction at all.","title":"Scopes"},{"location":"tutorials/fundamentals/scopes/#scopes","text":"When you create many objects at once, you often want to :destroy() them together later.

This means that rearranging the words in the input array will just rearrange the lengths in the output array: ForValues takes advantage of this - when input values move around, the output values will move around too, instead of being recalculated. Note that values are only reused once. For example, if you added another occurence of 'Orange', your calculation would have to run again for the second 'Orange':","title":"Usage"}]}
