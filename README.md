### Futuristic Luau for every universe.

Fusion is a portable Luau companion library for simpler, more descriptive code.

With Fusion, assemble straightforward chains of logic that are easy to understand,
predict and debug. Make strong guarantees about what your code will or won't do.
Build joyfully custom-fitted APIs to interact with the world outside of your code.

Fusion provides batteries-included configuration for Roblox, and fantastic extensibility
and integration for anything else Luau.
