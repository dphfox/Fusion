**Rediscover the joy of coding.**

Code is more dynamic, complex and intertwined than ever before. Errors cascade
out of control, things update in the wrong order, and it's all connected by
difficult, unreadable spaghetti.

No longer. Fusion introduces modern 'reactive' concepts for managing code, so
you can spend more time getting your logic right, and less time implementing
buggy boilerplate code connections.

Starting from simple roots, concepts neatly combine and build up with very little
learning curve. At every stage, you can robustly guarantee what your code will
do, and when you come back in six months, your code is easy to pick back up.
